# Minecraft Peridynamics

A Minecraft-like project exploring world generation using WebGL.

## How to Run

Go into minecraft folder and type "http-server dist -c-1" or ".\win_server.PS1"

## Controls

### Movment:

```
"KeyW": Move player foward case
"KeyA": Move player left case
"KeyS": Move player back case
"KeyD": Move player right case
"Space": Jump player up 1 block case
"ControlLeft": Crouch player down 1 block case
"ShiftLeft": Sprint increase the players speed by 2x case â€‹
"ArrowUp": Jump player up 1 block case
"ArrowDown": Crouch player down 1 block
"KeyC": Switch between survival and creative. Changes camera and removes gravity
"KeyP": Switches into pointer lock mode. Click the page and it will lock you in so it feels like a real game.
```

A1: The first thing was were able to generate with our modified code from a previous project.

A2: Our first steps in loading texture maps.

A3: Our first attempts at making noise using a basic algorithm. This was not optimized and had man bugs.

A4: Our first attempt at Chunk generation. Was not correct due to our coordinates being off, along with a few other issues.

A5: Progress being made to our chunk generation as the chunks would follow the player although only in +z direction and with empty chunks in between.

A6: When we got chunk generation to work, however ineffectively. Our first attempt at trees. When survival mode player controls were corrected.

A7: Working trees along with a nice noise algorithm.

A8: Player gravity implemented as well as a buggy day/night cycle that would reset from back to light blue rather than the gradient. A9: Fixed day-night cycle, made chunk loading smoother, made project look nice, fixed controls, etc.
